            with us, and thank you so much for believing and supporting us. We'll continue the vision we built with The
            Escapist here on Second Wind.<br><br>- Nick Calandra<br>Content Director</p>

        <p> If a subordinating conjunction gets attached to a clause, it turns it into a dependent clause. These


            conjunctions are used to signify different kinds of relationships between independent and dependent clauses.
            Some of these conjunctions show a contrast between two statements or ideas, while others indicate a
            cause-and-effect relationship.</p>

        <p> Text messaging, or texting, is the act of composing and sending electronic messages, typically consisting of
            alphabetic and numeric characters, between two or more users of mobile devices, desktops/laptops, or another
            type of compatible computer. Text messages may be sent over a cellular network or may also be sent via
            satellite or Internet connection.</p>

        <p> The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS). It has grown beyond
            alphanumeric text to include multimedia messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) containing
            digital images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known as emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and
            other icons), and instant messenger applications (usually the term is used when on mobile devices).</p>

        <p> Text messages are used for personal, family, business, and social purposes. Governmental and
            non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues. In the 2010s, the
            sending of short informal messages became an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with
            emailing.[1] This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues,
            including in contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or
            when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and voicemail, and
            unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not require the
            caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even between busy
            individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact with automated systems, for example, to order
            products or services from e-commerce websites or to participate in online contests. Advertisers and service
            providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment due dates,
            and other notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.</p>
